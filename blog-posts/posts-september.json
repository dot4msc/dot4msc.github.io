      "text": "<p>Well, this is my personal blog, where I will be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and probably some respectful venting toward certain people whom I will not be naming explicitly. Having said that, I want to point out a few things first:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> All the experiences and thoughts expressed in these future blog posts are only about 10% believable; however, the opinions I hold are, in my view, 100% true.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> As I mentioned, I will not be disclosing any personal information about these people. Instead, I’ve decided to identify them with Greek letters (Lambda, Gamma, Alpha, etc.). I think it’s best if you know a little about each person’s background to some extent (career, profession, family)—of course, without revealing too much private information.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> The people referred to by Greek letters are completely unrelated to my family, close friends, ex-girlfriends, co-workers, and so on. I will only mention people within my personal circle. So, if by coincidence you think that one of these people is you, let me just say: get your head out of the gutter. You are not on my mind at that moment. You’ll know who you are based on the Greek letter I use.</p><p>With that said, I hope you enjoy these stories. I also want to make it clear that I will not discuss these posts with anyone privately—because I know you won’t understand.</p><p>- Nano</p>"
