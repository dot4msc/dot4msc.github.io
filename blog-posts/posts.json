      "text": "<p>Well, this is my personal blog, where I will be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and probably some respectful venting toward certain people whom I will not be naming explicitly. Also this is my way of \"promoting\" my new <strong><u>album</u></strong> by, God willing, early 2027. I think you can guess the title by now. Having said that, I want to point out a few things first:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> All the experiences and thoughts expressed in these future blog posts are only about 10% believable; however, the opinions I hold are, in my view, 100% true.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> As I mentioned, I will not be disclosing any personal information about these people. Instead, I’ve decided to identify them with Greek letters (Lambda, Gamma, Alpha, etc.). I think it’s best if you know a little about each person’s background to some extent (career, profession, family)—of course, without revealing too much private information.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> The people referred to by Greek letters are completely unrelated to my family, close friends, ex-girlfriends, co-workers, and so on. I will only mention people within this \"unknown\" personal circle, referred to as \"The Team\". So, if by coincidence you think that one of these people is you, let me just say: get your head out of the gutter. You are not on my mind at that moment. You’ll know who you are based on the Greek letter I use.</p><p>With that said, I hope you enjoy these stories. I also want to make it clear that I will not discuss these posts with anyone privately—because I don't have the time nor patience to discuss these personal matters.</p><p>Tommorrow I'll begin my personal, raw, emotional rambling and hoping no one will worry about it<p>- Nano</p>",
