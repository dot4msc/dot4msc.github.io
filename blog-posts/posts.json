      "text": "<p>Well, hello again, dear reader. Like I said, I’ll keep this one a little lighter and just share what’s on my mind right now.</p>\n\n<p>I’m writing this just before my music production and composition class at a private cultural center near my house. Honestly, I don’t think anyone’s showing up today. Maybe “music production” just sounds too intimidating for young teens. I’ve thought about renaming it to something friendlier, like “music building.” Or maybe we just need better promotion—flyers outside schools, or even ads on Facebook and Instagram so the course pops up for anyone, anytime. Still, I’m hanging on. This is already the second day with no students, but as the center’s manager always says: “Hope is the last thing that dies.” In Spanish—“La esperanza es lo último que muere”—it hits even harder. And truthfully, I hold onto that every time I feel like quitting. When I’m drained, sad, and telling myself, “Everything is pointless. I’m 28, it’s too late,” I remind myself: maybe things feel pointless right now, but hope is always the last thing that dies. I’ve been at this for six years, and at least today, at 28, I feel like I’m finally moving forward.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, I worked on a project that reminded me why I love this. My vocal coach asked me to record her students for International Children’s Day, singing “Que Canten Los Niños” (“Let the Kids Sing”). It was amazing. Producing and editing each of the 12 kids’ vocals was fun on its own, but when the chorus came in and ALL of them sang together… wow. It gave me chills. Being trusted with that project was so fulfilling, and it pushed me to finally start my own studio: <em><strong>Casa 4 Studio</strong></em> (pronounced “Casa Cuatro Studio”—though people can call it “House 4” if they prefer). I’m even remodeling a small family space to turn it into a real physical studio. That feels like progress.</p>\n\n<p>Still… Lambda doesn’t get it. I know, I should work harder, stop making excuses, and push myself instead of drowning in pessimism. Believe me—I know! But can’t you see where I am right now? You know the struggles I’ve lived through. Last year I barely did anything, and the little I did you brushed off. I don’t care if “I’m better than this.” That’s why I told you I can’t even think about being with you. You’re far away now, just a memory. And like I said before, it’ll take as long as it takes—so please, just let me be. I’m sorry I didn’t map out my life the way you did 20+ years ago. I get it—you had your first album at 14. Congrats. But while I was just learning to believe in myself six years ago, you were already celebrating platinum records. Just… let me be. When I release <strong>Lambda’s Lullaby</strong>, I hope you’ll finally understand instead of leaning on HEX every single time.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I’ll stop here. And yes, I’m posting this as-is—no filters. Thanks for sticking around. As always, you can reach me on my socials (links are up top). See you tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>- Nano</p>",

      "text":"<p>Hey! Welcome back to the blog. If this is your first time reading, let me officially welcome you to the weird and fun world of dot4 (pronounced either \"dot four\" or \"dota\"—I still haven’t decided, so take your pick). Here, I share absurd stories and experiences I’ve had over my 28 years of life on Earth. I also just added an \"archive\" page where you can check out older posts—follow this <strong><a href=\"./archive/archive.html\">link</a></strong> right here! If you’ve already read my last two posts, congratulations and thank you for keeping up with my chaos. For me, the most important thing is that you have fun while reading, because trust me—these stories only get crazier. So, without further ado, let’s continue...</p>\n\n<p>I remember standing up from my bed and moving closer to the TV when I first met Teacup, Gamma, and Lambda. For me, changing positions felt like trying to make sense of what was happening. I needed a physical object, something to ground me, to “translate” these voices that were coming out of my own mouth. Almost like I had to simulate talking to someone. Anyway, as I said in the last post, when Lambda introduced herself, she had this shy energy—kind of like Hinata whenever she tried to talk to Naruto. I said, \"Hi Lambda. Are you going to be one of my best friends too?\" My tone was curious. She replied, \"Yes… well, kind of… I like you… maybe later on you could be my boyfriend.\"</p>\n\n<p>Looking back, I was shocked. It’s not that I don’t think I’m handsome enough to get a girlfriend, but in school—elementary, middle, and high school—I never saw myself as someone who instantly attracted girls. Yet, at that moment, I barely reacted. I think I smiled a little, but that was it. I said, \"Wow… but I don’t know you, and you don’t know me.\" She just smiled and said, \"I know you—through <em>The Girls of Han</em>.\" <em><strong>The Girls of Han</strong></em> were some close friends of mine. Then Lambda added, \"But they call me Polly,\" with this mysterious tone. I just looked at the floor and said, \"Okay...\" In hindsight, I probably should have asked, \"Why do you like me?\" because honestly, it’s wild to think this \"Lambda\" supposedly had a crush on me for 20 years. I’ve never been the most confident or the kind of guy women fall for. Heck, I even get anxious ordering food at a restaurant. Maybe I’m exaggerating, but back then, before trying to rebrand myself as an artist, I couldn’t even stand taking pictures of myself. If it were up to me, I’d only share graphics, drawings, and screen recordings of my sessions—because honestly, I’ve always hated the camera.</p>\n\n<p>Those were the last words Lambda and I exchanged… at least for a while. Then Teacup chimed in suddenly: \"Your father is still alive.\" I said, \"That’s not true, he passed away last year… I went to his funeral, mass, everything.\" But without hesitation, Teacup replied, \"No, he isn’t. But he’s not a man anymore… she’s a woman.\" Then this woman spoke: \"Hey Nano, it’s me… I’m The Patriot.\" (That’s just a pseudonym—I don’t want to reveal too much here.) \"Dad?\" I asked. She responded flatly, \"No. Your dad died of a heart attack last year. I’m not your dad. You don’t know me yet, but you will later.\" The way she said it felt hypnotic. My vision blurred, and green spots appeared everywhere. If you want a visual, Google \"Giygas Earthbound\"—those ghostly, terrifying faces moving around the screen. That’s exactly what it felt like. Then she ordered, \"Go to the bathroom and look in the mirror.\"</p>\n\n<p>I stood up, shivering, terrified of what might happen. Slowly, a black frame closed in around my vision—like when a camera focuses and the borders darken. She said, \"Don’t be afraid Nano! Calm down, okay? Nothing’s going to happen. I’m just going to erase this memory from your head.\" She even said it jokingly, like it was a prank. And honestly, looking back, it kind of was. It reminded me of those spy movies where a random phrase activates a sleeper agent. That’s what \"Teacup\" felt like—an activation word. Simple, strange, and kind of funny.</p>\n\n<p>I laughed nervously and said, \"Okay.\" She asked, \"You don’t want to remember any of this, right?\" I answered, \"I actually don’t mind.\" There was this comedic pause, then The Patriot said, \"I know, but I don’t want to scare your mother. You don’t want her worrying about silly things, right?\" \"Yeah, I guess not,\" I replied. In the bathroom mirror, she instructed me to repeat after her. I agreed and said the words firmly, staring at my own reflection: \"Look into my eyes. Nothing is happening right now. You haven’t met anyone. You didn’t talk to anyone. Everything was just your imagination. Teacup, Gamma, Lambda, and The Patriot don’t exist. You’re going to fall asleep, and none of this ever happened.\"</p>\n\n<p>After that, I went back to bed. I started to drift off, hearing only faint mumbles—like whispers from a distant speaker. Then, nothing. I guess I just fell asleep.</p>\n\n<p>So yeah! Could you keep up? Pretty wild, right? That spy-movie vibe still blows my mind. I debated whether I should just dismiss this whole experience, but in the end, this is how I express feelings about things I still don’t understand—but that once felt so real. Maybe I rambled too much or confused you a bit. One day, I might make an abridged version of this story so it lands more clearly. Anyway, thanks again for sticking with me to the end. This one ran a little long, but I’ll keep things lighter in future posts. I know I said at the start that I wouldn’t share these private matters, but if you have feedback—or just want to let something out—hit me up on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dot4music\">Instagram</a> DMs. I’d be glad to hear from you. Thanks again, and I’ll catch you tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>- Nano</p>",

      "text": "<p>Yesterday I had to run some errands for the company—mostly driving around in my car, picking up material necessary for the product we're building. I really enjoy those drives because I get to spend anywhere from 40 minutes to even 2 hours just driving around the city, thinking about what I want to do with my music and this blog. While driving on the highway I thought: \"What can I really talk about? What’s too sensitive or offensive? What’s considered 'crossing the line'?\" Then I thought, \"Well, let’s start with something so f***ing crazy nobody would believe it. In the end, I already put that in the disclaimer today!\" Either way, I kept thinking it doesn’t matter if anyone else believes it. What matters is that at least <em>The Team</em> would know it’s true.</p><p>The year was 2005. I was 8 years old. We had just moved from my house in the middle of nowhere to somewhere a bit closer to society. It was a cold night—normal weather for the city I was living in. I was in my pajamas, ready to go to sleep with the shades open. To be honest, I felt comfortable like that, with the streetlights piercing through my window. I was ready to fall asleep, until I felt something in my mind—like some sort of external thought passing through it. Almost as if Professor Xavier himself was trying to read my mind. I spoke out loud: \"Hello… who are you?\" and a voice responded: \"Well, in your cousin’s house I’m known simply as Teacup.\" I’m translating roughly here; the actual conversation was in Spanish, and his name was <em>Tesito</em>—which literally means \"little tea.\" I just thought Teacup sounded better.</p><p>Anyway, it wasn’t as if I was just hearing a voice in my head. It was as if this voice was speaking <em>through</em> me. I was talking, but it wasn’t me talking—it was Teacup. \"Oh, hi,\" I responded, my tone more curious than scared, as if the feeling was somehow familiar. Later, Teacup introduced me to his friends: \"I wanted to introduce you to my friends Gamma and Lambda.\" Each one greeted me—again, through my own voice. I remember Gamma being full of energy, saying we were going to be the best of friends. There was a kind of resignation in her tone when she said that. Gamma reminded me: \"You already know me. Your cousin and sister talked about me—that I burned with a match back at your old house.\" I said, \"Oh yeah, that you burned every part of your body.\" She snapped back, annoyed: \"NO, I ONLY BURNED MY FINGERS!\" I wanted to laugh, but I stayed serious throughout the whole encounter.</p><p>Then Lambda spoke—shy, hesitant, almost whispering: \"Hi, I’m Lambda…\"</p><p>I think I’ll stop here and split this story into two parts. Not to drag it out, but because there’s still more to say and I’d rather not rush it. And honestly, I know how this must sound—like some made-up fantasy or the kind of story only a crazy person would keep repeating. I’ve told it before, and most people just don’t take it seriously. That’s fine. Believe it, don’t believe it—that’s up to you. For me, this is real. Writing it down here is just my way of giving it one more chance to be heard. And yeah, maybe part of me is doing this because I want my album to get somewhere. Maybe this whole thing is just me being pathetic and trying to get attention. Call it self-pity, call it promotion, call it whatever you want—I don’t really care anymore. At least you’re still reading.</p><p>P.S: Lambda, Gamma, Alpha, and Orion… please stay until the end. I promise it’s going to be worth your time.</p><p>- Nano</p>",

      "text": "<p>Well, this is my personal blog, where I will be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and probably some respectful venting toward certain people whom I will not be naming explicitly. Also this is my way of \"promoting\" my new <strong><u>album</u></strong> by, God willing, early 2027. I think you can guess the title by now. Having said that, I want to point out a few things first:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> All the experiences and thoughts expressed in these future blog posts are only about 10% believable; however, the opinions I hold are, in my view, 100% true.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> As I mentioned, I will not be disclosing any personal information about these people. Instead, I’ve decided to identify them with Greek letters (Lambda, Gamma, Alpha, etc.). I think it’s best if you know a little about each person’s background to some extent (career, profession, family)—of course, without revealing too much private information.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> The people referred to by Greek letters are completely unrelated to my family, close friends, ex-girlfriends, co-workers, and so on. I will only mention people within this \"unknown\" personal circle, referred to as \"The Team\". So, if by coincidence you think that one of these people is you, let me just say: get your head out of the gutter. You are not on my mind at that moment. You’ll know who you are based on the Greek letter I use.</p><p>With that said, I hope you enjoy these stories. I also want to make it clear that I will not discuss these posts with anyone privately—because I don't have the time nor patience to discuss these personal matters.</p><p>Tommorrow I'll begin my personal, raw, emotional rambling and hoping no one will worry about it<p>- Nano</p>",
